// mkdir Client (create a Client folder first)

// mkdir Server (create a Server folder then)

//Using npm create-react-app . inside the client folder is for creating a React application in that directory.

//Running npm init -y inside the server folder is for setting up a Node.js project specifically for my backend development. It initializes a Node.js project and creates a package.json file with default settings.
